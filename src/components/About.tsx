            <p>With over eight years of experience in systems and data analysis, I want to apply my strong analytical background to biomedical research.  I am interested in hormonally-mediated diseases, especially endometriosis.  I would love to improve the endometriosis diagnosis and treatment process.  I am currently volunteering for Dr. Ece Mutlu's lab at the University of Illinois - Chicago and am comfortable working with R analysis pipelines.</p>
